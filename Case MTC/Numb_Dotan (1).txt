I've been lost inside a million eyes
They don't see me, they don't know what it's like
Trading colours into black and white
No one's reading all the words that I write
Low, feel the weight of the world in my bones
Try to swim but I'm sinking alone
Always falling in the deep unknown
Now I'm fighting with my hands up, hands up
Feel the bullets from your head rush, head rush
I can see you but I can't touch, can't touch
'Cause I feel numb
So infected with your bad blood, bad blood
Keep on running till it blows up, blows up
All I wanted was a real love
But I feel numb
Silent voices to a distant crowd
I'm still singing but there's no one around
I keep screaming till my lungs run out
But no one listens, no words coming out
Low, feel the weight of the world in my bones
Try to swim but I'm sinking alone
Always falling in the deep unknown
Now I'm fighting with my hands up, hands up
Feel the bullets from your head rush, head rush
I can see you but I can't touch, can't touch
'Cause I feel numb
So infected with your bad blood, bad blood
Keep on running till it blows up, blows up
All I wanted was a real love
But I feel numb
I feel numb, numb
(All I wanted was a real love)
Numb
(But I feel numb)
I feel numb, numb
(All I wanted was a real love)
Numb
(But I feel numb)
Low, feel the weight of the world in my bones
Try to swim but I'm sinking alone
Always falling in the deep unknown
Now I'm fighting with my hands up, hands up
Feel the bullets from your head rush, head rush
I can see you but I can't touch, can't touch
'Cause I feel numb
So infected with your bad blood, bad blood
Keep on running till it blows up, blows up
All I wanted was a real love
But I feel numb
I feel numb, numb
(All I wanted was a real love)
Numb
(But I feel numb)
I feel numb, numb
(All I wanted was a real love)
(But I feel numb)
